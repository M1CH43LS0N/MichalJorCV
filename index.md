# Hi, my name is Michal.

I‚Äôm 28-yo QA Engineer and technology enthusiast with interests in various multimedia, art, and design. I have experience with both front-end and back-end testing, mobile application testing and hardware testing. I‚Äôm currently working on a website for my hobbies and learning automation.

## How to contact me

My full name is **Michal Jor** and I currently live in üìç **Jiƒç√≠n, Czech Republic**.

You can drop me a line at ‚úâÔ∏è [michal.jor96@gmail.com](mailto:michal.jor96@gmail.com).  
I can be found on social networks ‚Äî such as [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michal-jor-b941731a4/?locale=en_US) or [GitHub](https://github.com/M1CH43LS0N).

## What I do

I‚Äôm a QA Engineer with an emphasis on the **manual testing of web and mobile apps**, and I consider mobile testing as my main focus. I have extensive experience with writing step-by-step and BDD testing scenarios. On my initiative, I maintain a knowledge-know-how database. When possible, I organize retrospectives. I am a technical recruiter when interviewing new QA members for my team. Last but not least, I maintain a proactive approach to troubleshooting and communicating issues.

### Testing & Testing Techniques

I try to cover all corners of the field, from control of interactive elements & features to UI design and UX to the overall final result presented to users. I value good testing practices. I keep clean reports and try to guide others to do the same. I record all preconditions for a specific flow in the knowledge database.

I also like **open-source** and non-proprietary solutions, so for example, it shouldn‚Äôt be surprising that this resume is [a Markdown file](https://github.com/marianhlavac/marianhlavac-cz/blob/master/index.md) that can be converted easily into PDF, this website, or printed.  

### Hobbies & Other skills

I often spend some time improving myself in different fields. I actually have much more hobbies than the below listed, but I find hobbies such as ‚Äúcooking‚Äù, highly irrelevant to the purpose of this page.

*   **3D printing** ‚Äî So far I'm using other professionals' designs more, but I'm slowly getting into 3D modelling software like Tinkercad or Onshape.
*   **Game development** ‚Äî So far this is only theoretical knowledge, however, I plan to create projects in the Godot engine, which uses GDScript's syntax that is mostly derived from Python.
*   **Laser engraving** ‚Äî So far I only engrave wood, but I want to work my way up to more complex materials.
*   **Drone** ‚Äî After completing the pilot tests (A1 & A3) I invest more free time to capture the world from a bird's eye view.
*   **Exercise** ‚Äî Due to the nature of my job, I try to spend an hour a day exercising to lead a healthier lifestyle.
*   **Photography, Video editing**
*   **Music** ‚Äî I play the acoustic guitar as a self-taught artist, but I am gradually expanding my horizons to other instruments as well.
