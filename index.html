        <h1 id="hi-mynameismichal">Hi, my name is Michal.</h1>

<p>I‚Äôm 28-yo QA Engineer and technology enthusiast with interests
in various multimedia, art, and design.
I have experience with both front-end and back-end testing, 
mobile application testing and hardware testing.
I‚Äôm currently working on a website for my hobbies and learning automation.

<h2 id="how-to-contact-me">How to contact me</h2>

<p>My full name is <strong>Michal Jor</strong> and I currently live
in üìç <strong>Jiƒç√≠n, Czech Republic</strong>.</p>

<p>You can drop me a line at  ‚úâÔ∏è <a href="mailto:michal.jor96@gmail.com">michal.jor96@gmail.com</a>.<br />
I can be found on social networks ‚Äî such as
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michal-jor-b941731a4/?locale=en_US" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/M1CH43LS0N" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>

<p>I‚Äôm a QA Engineer with an emphasis on the
<strong>manual testing of web and mobile apps</strong>, and I consider mobile testing as my main focus.
I have extensive experience with writing step-by-step and BDD testing scenarios.
On my initiative, I maintain a knowledge-know-how database.
When possible, I organize retrospectives.
I am a technical recruiter when interviewing new QA members for my team.
Last but not least, I maintain a proactive approach to troubleshooting and communicating issues.</p>

<h3 id="testing--testing-techniques">Testing & Testing Techniques</h3>
<p>I try to cover all corners of the field, from control of interactive elements & features to UI design and UX to the overall final result
  presented to users.
  I value good testing practices. I keep clean reports and try to guide
  others to do the same. I record all preconditions for a specific flow in the knowledge database.</p>

<p>I also like <strong>open-source</strong> and non-proprietary solutions, 
so for example, it shouldn‚Äôt be surprising that this resume is 
<a href="https://github.com/M1CH43LS0N/MichalJorCV/blob/development/index.md">a Markdown file</a>
that can be converted easily into PDF, this website, or printed.<br />
</p>

<h3 id="hobbies--other-skills">Hobbies &amp; Other skills</h3>
<p>I often spend some time improving myself in different fields. I actually 
have much more hobbies than the below listed, but I find hobbies such as ‚Äúcooking‚Äù, highly irrelevant to the 
purpose of this page.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>3D printing</strong> ‚Äî So far I'm using other professionals' designs more, but I'm slowly getting into 3D modelling software like Tinkercad or Onshape.</li>
  <li><strong>Game development</strong> ‚Äî So far this is only theoretical knowledge, however, I plan to create projects in the Godot engine, which uses GDScript's syntax that is mostly derived from Python.</li>
  <li><strong>Laser engraving</strong> ‚Äî So far I only engrave wood, but I want to work my way up to more complex materials.</li>
  <li><strong>Drone</strong> ‚Äî After completing the pilot tests (A1 & A3) I invest more free time to capture the world from a bird's eye view.</li>
  <li><strong>Exercise</strong> ‚Äî Due to the nature of my job, I try to spend an hour a day exercising to lead a healthier lifestyle.</li>
  <li><strong>Photography, Video editing</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Music</strong> ‚Äî I play the acoustic guitar as a self-taught artist, but I am gradually expanding my horizons to other instruments as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>Soon, I would like to move to a higher level and automate the testing processes. 
  Based on this, I am self-studying Python, however, I would like to automate using TypeScript in the Playwright framework in the coming years.
</p>
<p> 
In the time frame of 5 years, I would like to develop into a front-end developer using React.
