        <h1 id="hi-mynameismari√°n">Hi, my name is Mari√°n.</h1>

<p>I‚Äôm 26-yo full-stack web developer and technology enthusiast with interests
in various multimedia, art, and design.
I have experience with both front-end and back-end web development, 
mobile application development,
project design, UI/UX design, and hardware.
I‚Äôm currently working on a <a href="https://getdronetag.com" target="_blank">device to make drones smarter and safe to access our airspace</a>.<br />
I also teach 3D Printing
at <a href="http://fit.cvut.cz" target="_blank">Czech Technical University in Prague</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-contact-me">How to contact me</h2>

<p>My full name is <strong>Mari√°n Hlav√°ƒç</strong> and I currently live
in üìç <strong>Prague, Czech Republic</strong>.</p>

<p>You can drop me a line at  ‚úâÔ∏è <a href="mailto:m@marianhlavac.cz">m@marianhlavac.cz</a>.<br />
I can be found on social networks ‚Äî such as
<a href="http://linkedin.com/in/marian-hlavac" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, 
<a href="http://github.com/marianhlavac" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, 
<a href="http://fb.com/marian.hlavac" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, 
or <a href="http://twitter.com/mmajko" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-do">What I do</h2>

<p>I‚Äôm a full-stack developer with an emphasis on the 
<strong>front-end technologies</strong>, and I consider web technologies as my main focus.
I also develop mobile applications, using multi-platform mobile frameworks.
Other than that, I sometimes do UI design, develop games, or fiddle with
hardware, but those skills are not much serious.</p>

<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>I try to cover all corners of the field, from setting up the server, 
writing the code while keeping the code maintainable, to
testing with users, focusing on good UI and UX and overall final result
presented to users.</p>

<p>In the last months, the majority of the code I wrote was in <strong>Python</strong>, 
<strong>Dart</strong> (using Flutter SDK) and <strong>TypeScript</strong> (using React).
From time to time I write a few lines in
in <strong>Swift</strong>, <strong>Kotlin</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>Rust</strong> or other languages.</p>

<h3 id="development-techniques--project-management">Development Techniques &amp; Project Management</h3>
<p>I value good development practices. I keep clean commit history and try to guide
others to do the same. Code reviews are for sure, as well as CI/CD,
routine automation, or automated code tests.</p>

<p>I also like <strong>open-source</strong> and non-proprietary solutions, 
so for example, it shouldn‚Äôt be surprising that this resume is 
<a href="https://github.com/marianhlavac/marianhlavac-cz/blob/master/index.md">a Markdown file</a>
that can be converted easily into PDF, this website, or printed.<br />
Or some would say I‚Äôm just a big nerd. Also true.</p>

<h3 id="hobbies--other-skills">Hobbies &amp; Other skills</h3>
<p>I often spend some time improving myself in different fields. I actually 
have much more hobbies than the below listed, but I find hobbies such as 
‚Äúplaying Tetris‚Äù or ‚Äúcooking‚Äù, highly irrelevant to the 
purpose of this page.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Design</strong> ‚Äî I like designing user interfaces, print design, 
3D modelling etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Game development</strong> ‚Äî Both my bachelor and master thesis were dedicated to 
exploring the possibilities of XR (Virtual Reality &amp; Augmented Reality).</li>
  <li><strong>Hardware</strong> ‚Äî Arduino, Raspberry Pi, robotics and other embedded systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Photography, Video editing</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Music composition &amp; production</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-past-experiences">My past experiences</h2>

<p>For almost a decade I dedicated myself to gaining experiences in web
technologies. I started small, creating websites for my friends and colleagues
in the old-school Xara Designer, then continued to learn how to program
small web apps in PHP, and now I‚Äôm in charge of the technical infrastructure of
a young technological start-up. Whew, time flies.</p>

in the Space Application Hackathon competition and decided not to leave
the idea right after. In Dronetag, I put myself in the role of
technological manager, created the foundations for underlying technologies
that power Dronetag‚Äôs web platform and continues to work on them, as well
as work on the user interface of all client applications.</li>
